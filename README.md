# Cake-Shop-Queue-Data-Structure

A cake shop requires a program to read and print data from an input file to the output files that they are designated. 

To sort this problem out, we use the fundamentals data structure specifically the queue data structure to sort, align, read and print the data from the input file and onto the output files.

The input file is cakeOrder.txt , and we need to read the data inside it, sort and print the data into their respected output files based on type of delivery.
